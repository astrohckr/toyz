   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Coming Soon
===========
I'm still finishing transfering Toyz from the old `astropyp <https://github.com/fred3m/astropyp>`_
format. Some of the features that should be complete within the next week or two are
**workspaces**, interactive **Highcharts** and **Graph3d** plots, and thorough documentation
about how to incorporate your own scripts into a toyz application. Stay tuned.
