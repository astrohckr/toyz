toyz
====

Interface to run python plots and scripts from a web browser

This package is being converted from [astropyp](https://github.com/fred3m/astropyp) and 
[astro_pypelines](https://github.com/fred3m/astro_pypelines) into a more complete (and less specialized)
data analysis package. This is an ongoing process and Toyz isn't quite working properly yet, however if 
you install [astropyp](https://github.com/fred3m/astropyp) and 
[astro_pypelines](https://github.com/fred3m/astro_pypelines) you will be able to use a preview of the package 
as applied to astronomy.

The goal is for the main interface to be completed by the end of 2014 while the astronomy tools should 
be ready in January or February.
